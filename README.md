# Monday Bot : Discord Edition
Sadly, I couldn't get this to work in Python, so I rewrote it in Node.js. [You can find it here.](https://github.com/Loloweb/MondayBotJS)

A Python Discord bot that writes "Monday!" every Monday at midnight GMT.

Requires discord.py : ```pip install discord```

Made for a friend.
